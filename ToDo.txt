TBD:
- Unloading Mechanic
- Misfires, Jams, Muskets need to be cleaned you know
- Flintlock System needs to become Integers instead of Arrays, powder could feed from the URL
- Blunderbuss & Flintlock Pistols
- Fix Commando to have jams, unjams by pulling the charging handle
- Musket can't be reloaded while rolling, stand up for bonuses, etc. etc.
- Terminator: Tie recoil to Strength factor, Slugs, tweak 'n test
- Stryker: Add a mechanic to dump empty rounds (most likely a hold unload to just click-click-click through them), Slugs, Full-Auto mode & a Silenced version
- Add other shells to the striker and pipegun, at least slugs.
- **PLEASE** make the Radsuit better
- Gas, WP and Incendiary Grenades would be fun :)
- Flamethrowah
- Artillery Radio
- Helmet Support for the APK
- Fix commando's pickup Sprites
- Fix the Commando and Mac-11's HUD Sprites
- Fix the commando's charging Sprites
- Fix the commando's inventory icon
- Fix the commando's tags
- Increase the Mac-11's recoil
- Tweak trite drops. - Ted.

Spriting & Overall Quality-work:
- Hammer Cocking Sprites
- Unique Weapon Sprites (done via model)
- Defibrillator
- Player Skins
- Trite Lootpools are wonky

BUGS:
- Either fix loadout code striker missing a shell or make the item one miss one shell also.
- Fix More trites not spawning after the current ones die

Monsters:
- Trites spawn in Nukage? idk
- ZSEC: Striker, Carbine, ZMs, Shotguns
- Old and NewVile Compat

Helmet:
-Oxygen Meter
-Mils System (but I'll take what I can get at this point)
-Screen Cracking/Damage System (Obviously the helmet repairs automatically)
-FAK Upgrades (Repair, See HP of friends, etc.)
-Camera System to see through your DERPs/Friends would be super cool.

Replacement Stuff:
- Gunpowder barrels for musket and maybe URL.
- Trite barrels, shoot 'em or get to close and they'll slowly creep out and such and if they explode even more trites come out.
- Various cans and such to randomly replace barrels. Include gremlin support, mainly for just random items though as decoration and variety.
